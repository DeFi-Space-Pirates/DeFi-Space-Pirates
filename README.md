# Project Roadmap (work in progress)

<h6>Disclaimer : This project is born to give me (and anyone who wants to contribute to the project) the possibility to learn Solidity and Hardhat</h6>

## Functionalities

### Doubloons (Common ERC1155 Token) : 

**Description**
- Multiverse utility tokens are implemented by compiling the standard ERC20 in the
ERC1155. Used as a currency in the game. The WebApp will include the pools bi
crypto with the major crypto (eth, Matic, usdt, etc) that lead also to the liquidity
farming that rewards the liquidity provider common token rewards. Will be also
added the possibility to stake this token obtaining others passively. Liquidity
Providers and staker can boost their rewards using a pet perk.

**Where to Obtain**
- It is obtainable through lots of places: as a staking reward staking [redacted]
Token (common version) and [redacted] Token (rare version), buy through the
bonds mechanism in the early phase, get through IDO, Airdrop, Seed Investor
investment. It can also be obtained by completing game quests (like dailys) and
rewards for single-player campaign levels competition. The token can be bet in a
3v3 battle in which the winner keeps the token. Tournaments rewards could also
reward participants with some common tokens.

### Asteroids (Rare ERC1155 Token) : 

**Description**
- Multiverse rare tokens are implemented by compiling the standard ERC20 in the
ERC1155. Used as a token for upgrading the pets in the game. The WebApp will
include the pools bi crypto with the major crypto (eth, Matic, usdt, etc) that lead
also to the liquidity farming that rewards the liquidity provider common token
rewards. This token can be divided into his underlying assets, the part used for
voting power, and the part used to stake and obtain common token rewards. You
can convert one rare Token into 1 voting token and 1 staking token and vice
versa.

- This token is obtainable by progressing the game and participating in in-game
events. This token represents the gamer’s consistency and participation with the
community and his progress

special gadgets. The NFT can also be bred by consuming an amount of this
token and locking for a mid-time duration period two NFTs.
The ve version of the token can be used as voting power.
The x version of the token can be staked receiving common tokens as rewards.
